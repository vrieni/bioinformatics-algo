#Problem
#Assume that an alphabet 𝒜A has a predetermined order; that is, we write the alphabet as a permutation 𝒜=(a1,a2,…,ak)A=(a1,a2,…,ak), where a1<a2<⋯<aka1<a2<⋯<ak. For instance, the English alphabet is organized as (A,B,…,Z)(A,B,…,Z).
#Given two strings ss and tt having the same length nn, we say that ss precedes tt in the lexicographic order (and write s<Lexts<Lext) if the first symbol s[j]s[j] that doesn't match t[j]t[j] satisfies sj<tjsj<tj in 𝒜A.
#Given: A collection of at most 10 symbols defining an ordered alphabet, and a positive integer nn (n≤10n≤10).
#Return: All strings of length nn that can be formed from the alphabet, ordered lexicographically."""
